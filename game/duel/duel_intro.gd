## THE PRE-DUEL SPLASH — who is about to play whom, with what.
##
## The 1997 game shows this between "Go" and the coin toss: two portraits
## in sunken wells on brown marble, `vs.` between them, each duelist's
## name under their face and *"playing with <deck>"* under that. The board
## itself — the art, the wells, the lettering, the portrait fallback — is
## [VersusPanel], which the Q/Esc [DuelPause] window shares; what is left
## here is this window's own two buttons and its five-second timer.
##
## WHAT IT SAYS. Everything comes off the [DuelConfig] the setup screen
## built: the names the player typed (an AI seat is HAL unless renamed),
## the decks they chose, and the portrait each seat picked. A seat with no
## chosen portrait falls back to its DUELIST face, which is derived from
## the deck's dominant colour — so the frame is never empty.
##
## HOW IT LEAVES, three ways: `Go!`, `Reconfigure duel` (back to the
## battle-setup screen), or five seconds of nobody touching anything,
## which is what keeps an AI demo — and the soak — moving.

## Seconds before it goes on by itself (the owner's number). THE ONLY
## CLOCK: it lives here and not in [VersusPanel], because the Pause window
## must never dismiss itself.
const TIMEOUT := 5.0

## [QoL] One shared reminder before a private duel, never a phase prompt.
const HOTSEAT_NOTICE := "Dear players, only show your hand when your opponent looks away. Good luck!"
