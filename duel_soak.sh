# THE DUEL SOAK — whole duels played through the LIVE duel screen under
# Xvfb on Linux or native windows on macOS, and a FAILURE on anything
# Godot prints while they play. The
# player is tools/duel_soak.gd; read its header for what the two modes do.
#
# Usage:
#   ./duel_soak.sh                          # 3 seeds, demo AND human seat
#   ./duel_soak.sh --mode human --count 10  # fuzz the human seat harder
#   ./duel_soak.sh --seeds 4242             # replay one seed (both modes)
#   ./duel_soak.sh --rules fifth            # every fork the 1997 way
#   ./duel_soak.sh --help
#   ./duel_soak.sh --version                # the one version string
#
# Exit 0 only when every duel reached game over AND the log holds no
# ERROR, WARNING or SCRIPT ERROR line beyond Xvfb's own two (the X input
# method and the V-Sync line, which every headless X server prints).
# A duel that stands still for --stall seconds (240) is a failure too —
# a stuck prompt is exactly what this exists to catch.
#
# EXIT CODES are the .gd's own when it set one: 2 for a STALL (a duel
# that stood still, or never started), 3 for a bad argument, 124 for the
# whole-run guard — and 1 when Godot exited 0 but printed an error or a
# warning, or never reached `SOAK done`. Godot's status is read FIRST,
# because a STALL line is also an "ERROR/WARNING/STALL" line and reading
# the grep first turned every exit 2 into an exit 1.
#
# THE RECIPE IS CONTRIBUTING.md's, and every part of it is load-bearing:
# `timeout` INSIDE xvfb-run so it signals Godot itself; output to a FILE,
# never a pipe (`--help` included — it used to pipe a headless Godot into
# grep); stdin closed. Ten duels take about three minutes; the whole-run
# guard is SOAK_TIMEOUT seconds (default 1800).

# THE FAMILY BANNER (tools/banner.sh): stderr, and only on a terminal.

# THE SOAK DOES NOT WRITE THE PLAYER'S PROFILE — the same isolation
# `run_tests.sh` carries, and for the same reason: `user://` is the
# EXPORTED game's own directory, and the soak fuzzes the live options
# panel inside it. It already put `settings.cfg` back byte for byte
# afterwards (`tools/duel_soak.gd`, `restore_settings`), which covers a
# run that finishes and not one that is killed. This covers both.
#
# Side effect worth knowing: with no player file to read, a soak with no
# `--rules` argument plays under the BUILT-IN rules defaults rather than
# under whatever the player last chose — which is what a soak wanted
# anyway. Override with SHANDALAR_TEST_DATA_HOME.
