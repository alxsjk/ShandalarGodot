"""The two rules about the TRACKED TREE itself, as a test.

Both are written down in CONTRIBUTING.md and neither had anything holding
it: `docs/CODE_MAP.md` says *"Every file in the project and what lives in
it"* (hard rule 6: a new file gets a row), and the Publication section says
*"Keep personal home paths, private email addresses and local tooling
metadata out of tracked files"*. The release tooling already refuses a
staged package that names the builder's home (`package_release.guard_private`,
`build_release.sh`'s `guard_stage`) — that is the last door before an
upload, and this is the same check one step earlier, on everything that is
committed rather than on what is about to be zipped.

Found on 2026-09-17 by the first run: eight source files had no row.
